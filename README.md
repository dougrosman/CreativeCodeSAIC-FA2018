# CreativeCodeSAIC-FA2018
Coding exercises from class, tutor hours and beyond!

## The folders in this GitHub repository:

##### In-Class:
These sketches may replicate or expand on the exercises Adam demonstrates. This won't have everything we do in class, since there are times when I'm going around helping and not fully following along with Adam's code. Go to Adam's GitHub here for the class stuff: https://github.com/ajbajb/ARTTECH3135-fall2018

##### TA-Sessions:
Exercises we do in the weekly TA tutoring sessions. These exercises may go over specific coding tools and homework approaches.

##### Extra-Examples:
These are for-fun things, or other little example sketches that could be beneficial to look at. For example, that colorful animating sine-wave thing I showed in class is in here.
